== DESCRIPTION:

Hitch allows developers to be properly credited when Pair Programming and using Git.

== FEATURES:

* Persists pair(s) between different terminal instances.
* Creates a unique email address for the pair. (e.g. dev+leshill+therubymug@hashrocket.com) This provides the ability to create a Gravatar for the pair.

== SYNOPSIS:

- First, create your hitchrc by running:
  - hitch -m
- For therubymug and leshill to pair in the current project:
  - hitch leshill therubymug
- or globally:
  - hitch -g leshill therubymug
- To clear pair info (for the local project):
  - hitch -u
- To clear pair info in the global file:
  - hitch -u -g
- For a complete list of features:
  - hitch -h
- Creating a Gravatar for your pair:
  - Once I've hitched with my pair. (e.g. hitch leshill) I have now created a unique email: dev+leshill+therubymug@hashrocket.com
  - Then, I go to gravatar.com. Add an image to that particular email address and I'm done.
- If you want to allow different committer vs author, then:
  - unhitch    (unhitch the current project)
  - unhitch -g (globally unhitch)
  - add the following aliases to your .bashrc:
     alias hitch='hitch -p -g'
     alias unhitch='unhitch -p -g'
     alias git='[ -f ~/.hitch_export_authors ] && . ~/.hitch_export_authors; git'
